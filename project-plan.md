## Risk Assessment

Risk | Risk level | Mitigation | Response
---|---|---|---
Compatibility issues | Medium | Communication with customer to understand their systems, test on all browsers, use highly supported technologies. | Adapt solution to their system.
Misunderstanding customer goals | Low | Stay in communication with customer to clarify ambiguity. | Face to communication when needed.
Customers misunderstanding their own goals | High | Constantly verify requirements to make sure they know what they want. | Be prepared to adapt product to shifting requirements
Scope creep | High | Prioritised backlog, ensure customer understands how much work we are able to commit. | Work with customer so that they understand the situation.
Codebase maintainability issues | High | Stick to coding standards, define team standards. Pair programming, code reviews so that multiple people understand codebase. | Refactor or rewrite the code.
Performance/scalability issues | Low | Clarify expected use case (amount of users etc.) | Identify and address bottlenecks
Deployment issues | Low | Test on production environment early. | Adapt infrastructure to support customer environment.
Internal team conflicts | Medium | Team building activities, pub trips. | Mediate with lecturers if required.
Issues with new technologies | Medium | Use spikes (throw away code people used to learn with). | Have the courage to change technologies if they are not working for us.
Lost work due to technical issues | Low | Distributed version control. Good git workflow. | Restore from local copies of repos.
